# FinSight Lite

FinSight Lite is a financial literacy learning simulator that teaches school-aged users about money, saving, and investing using virtual money.

## Run & Operate

*   **Run Dev Server:** `npm run dev`
*   **Build Client:** `npm run build:client`
*   **Build Server:** `npm run build:server`
*   **Typecheck:** `npm run typecheck`
*   **Generate Drizzle Kit Migrations:** `drizzle-kit generate:pg`
*   **Push DB Schema:** `drizzle-kit push:pg`

**Required Environment Variables:**
*   `SESSION_SECRET` (for Express sessions)
*   `DATABASE_URL` (for PostgreSQL connection)
*   `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for Supabase integration)
*   `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (for Founder Admin Dashboard)

## Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Wouter, TanStack React Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts, React Hook Form, Zod
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM
*   **Build Tool:** Vite (client), esbuild (server)
*   **Runtime:** Node.js

## Where things live

*   `/client`: Frontend source code
*   `/server`: Backend source code
*   `/shared`: Shared types, schemas, and API contracts (source of truth for API)
*   `shared/schema.ts`: Database schema definition (source of truth for DB)
*   `shared/routes.ts`: API route definitions and Zod schemas (source of truth for API contracts)
*   `client/src/index.css`: Custom FinSight Lite design system (source of truth for theme)
*   `client/src/data/learning-content.ts`: Localized learning module content
*   `server/storage.ts`: Database operation abstraction
*   `server/replit_integrations/auth/`: Passwordless avatar-based authentication

## Architecture decisions

*   **Shared Type System:** `shared/` directory ensures type safety across frontend and backend with Drizzle ORM and Zod for API contracts.
*   **Multi-Auth Strategy:** Separate authentication flows for students (passwordless avatar-based), teachers (email/password with separate session key), and founder admins (hardcoded env vars).
*   **External Data Storage:** Replit Object Storage for public assets (logos), Supabase for organizational data, leaderboard snapshots, and analytics events to offload specific data types and leverage external capabilities.
*   **Gamification & Learning Modules:** All learning content and game logic are primarily frontend-driven (except for MoneyLab's AI features and progress tracking) to ensure responsiveness and minimize server load for interactive elements.
*   **Regional Localization:** Investment simulator and learning modules are deeply localized by currency, with real-life Caribbean examples dynamically loaded based on the user's selected region.

## User preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Gotchas

*   Always run `drizzle-kit generate:pg` after schema changes and `drizzle-kit push:pg` to apply migrations.
*   `SESSION_SECRET` and `DATABASE_URL` are critical for core functionality.
*   Supabase integration requires correct `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to be set.
*   Teacher login uses `bcryptjs` hashing; student login is passwordless.
*   Legacy logo URLs (`/uploads/logos/*`) are 308 redirected to `/public-objects/logos/*`.
*   **Contrast rule (light & dark mode):** `caribbean-bg` is always dark — use `text-white`. `glass-card`/`glass-card-teal`/`glass-card-coral` adapt between light and dark — always use `text-foreground` (semantic token) inside them. Never hardcode `text-gray-800`, `text-teal-900`, `text-blue-900`, etc. — they vanish in dark mode. Tinted labels must always pair a dark variant: `text-teal-800 dark:text-teal-200`. Coloured badges must include both `bg-X-100 text-X-700` and `dark:bg-X-900/40 dark:text-X-300`. Full rules are in the comment block at the top of `client/src/index.css`.
